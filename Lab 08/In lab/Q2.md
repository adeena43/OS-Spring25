# b) Both threads calculate different values of counter due to a race condition. Since counter is shared, both threads try to update it at the same time. The     increment operation (counter = counter + 1) is not atomic, meaning:

  # Both threads read the same value of counter.
    
  # Both increment it separately without knowing about the other.
    
  # One update gets lost, leading to incorrect results.
    
  # Since thread execution is unpredictable, the final value of counter varies every time.
